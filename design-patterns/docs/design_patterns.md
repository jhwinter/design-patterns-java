# Design Patterns

* A **design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a common problem within a
  specific context in software design.
* Patterns are **blueprints** that can be applied in multiple situations, but they are
  not direct pieces of code.
* They focus on **object interactions**, **system architecture**, and how
  classes/objects communicate.


## Benefits of Design Patterns

* **Code Reusability**: Patterns provide proven solutions that can be applied in
multiple projects.
* **Maintainability**: Encourages clean, understandable, and structured code,
which is easier to maintain and extend.
* **Communication**: Design patterns act as a common language between
developers, improving communication and understanding.
* **Scalability**: Design patterns help in structuring code to support future scaling
with fewer refactors.
* **Efficiency**: Avoids reinventing the wheel by using well-tested and widely
accepted solutions.

## Types of Design Patterns

* **Behavioral Patterns**: Focus on communication between objects and responsibilities.
Examples: Observer Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Command Pattern

* **Creational Patterns**: Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects
in a manner suitable to the situation.
Examples: Factory Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Builder Pattern

* **Structural Patterns**: Deal with the composition of objects or classes to form larger
structures.
Examples: Adapter Pattern, Composite Pattern, Decorator Pattern
