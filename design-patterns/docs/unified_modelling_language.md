# Unified Modelling Language (UML)

## UML Diagrams

* Unified Modeling Language to model systems
* The idea is to have a uniform way to represent the classes, objects, relationships and interactions within simple or complex systems to make it easier for developers and stakeholders to understand and communicate about the system.

## UML Diagrams Importance

* **Visualization**: UML diagrams provide a visual representation of a system, making it easier to understand the structure, relationships, and interactions between components.
* **Documentation**: They serve as detailed documentation for the software architecture, which is useful for maintaining and scaling the system.
* **Communication**: UML diagrams are a common language for software designers, developers, and stakeholders, facilitating communication about the design.
* **Standardization**: Since UML is a standardized language, it ensures that everyone involved understands the systemâ€™s design in the same way

## Basic Elements

1. **Class**: A blueprint for objects, defined with a name, attributes, and methods.
   * Example: `class User { name, age, login() }`
2. **Interface**: A contract that defines methods that a class must implement.
   * Example: `interface Loginable { login() }`
3. **Object**: An instance of a class at runtime.
4. **Association**: A relationship between two classes that represents interactions between objects.
5. **Inheritance**: Represents an "is-a" relationship, where a subclass inherits from a superclass.
6. **Composition**: A stronger association where one object is part of another and cannot exist independently.
7. **Aggregation**: A weaker form of association where one object contains another, but they can exist independently



## Class Diagrams

**Class Diagram**: Represents the static structure of a system, showing classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships between them (inheritance, association, etc.).

```java
class Player {
    private String name;
    public void pay() {}
}
```

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Player
    Player : -name
    Player : +pay()
```

> By default, we can assume that all attributes are private and all methods are public.

## Association

**Association** represents a relationship between two or more classes. In this case, each object in one class is associated with one or more objects of another class.

[AssociationExample](../src/main/java/org/prateek/Basics/UML/AssociationExample.java)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Teacher <-- Student : association
```

## Aggregation

**Aggregation** is a weak "has-a" relationship where one class contains objects of another class. However, the contained objects can exist independently of the container object. 

[AggregationExample](../src/main/java/org/prateek/Basics/UML/AggregationExample.java)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Department --o Professor : aggregation
```

## Composition

**Composition** is a strong "has-a" relationship, where one class owns objects of another class. If the container object is destroyed, the contained objects are destroyed as well. 

[CompositionExample](../src/main/java/org/prateek/Basics/UML/CompositionExample.java)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    House *-- Room : composition
```

### Composition vs Aggregation

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Company *-- Team : composition
    Team o-- Employee : aggregation

    note "Company has Teams. Teams have Employees."
    note for Company "Company owns Teams"
    note for Team "Team cannot exist outside of Company"
    note for Employee "weak association between Team and Employee because Employee still exists outside of Team"
```

## Inheritance

**Inheritance** defines an "is-a" relationship where a subclass inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from a superclass.

[InheritanceExample](../src/main/java/org/prateek/Basics/UML/InheritanceExample.java)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Animal <|-- Dog : inherits from
```

## Dependency

This is a relationship where one class relies on another in some way, often through method parameters, return types, or temporary associations.

[DependencyExample](../src/main/java/org/prateek/Basics/UML/DependencyExample.java)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Printer ..> Document : depends on
```

## Realization

A class implements the behavior defined by an interface.

[RealizationExample](../src/main/java/org/prateek/Basics/UML/RealizationExample.java)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Payment <|-- CreditCardPayment : implements
```



## Summary

* **Association**: Objects are related but can exist independently.
* **Aggregation**: A weak "has-a" relationship where the contained objects can exist independently.
* **Composition**: A strong "has-a" relationship where the contained objects cannot exist without the container.
* **Inheritance**: A subclass inherits from a superclass (is-a relationship).
* **Dependency**: One class depends on another for its functionality.
* **Realization**: A class implements the behavior defined by an interface.
