# DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Avoid code duplication by **reusing** existing code and organizing it into reusable functions, classes, and modules.

**Why It Matters**: Repeated code increases the risk of bugs, makes maintenance difficult, and increases the chance of inconsistencies.

**Example**:
Instead of writing the same database connection logic in multiple places, use a **DatabaseConnection** class that handles this logic, ensuring **code reuse**.
