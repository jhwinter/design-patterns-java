# Remote Control System Application Exercise

You are tasked with designing a simple Remote Control System that can operate different household devices such as lights and fans. The system should follow the **Command Design Pattern** to encapsulate all requests as command objects, allowing for flexible execution of these commands. The system should be designed to support the easy addition of new device commands while maintaining a clear structure for command execution.

**Task**:

Implement a remote control system using the Command Design Pattern that can manage the following operations:

* Turn on and off a light.
* Turn on and off a fan.

Your implementation should include a command interface that encapsulates the command execution methods.

**Output**:
* Your program should allow users to:
* Turn on the light and print a message indicating that the light is on.
* Turn off the light and print a message indicating that the light is off.
* Turn on the fan and print a message indicating that the fan is on.
* Turn off the fan and print a message indicating that the fan is off.

**Instructions**:
* You only need to complete the TODOs mentioned in the code.
* Please do not modify any existing code outside of the specified TODO sections.
