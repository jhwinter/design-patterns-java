# Stock Price Monitoring System Application Exercise

You are developing a stock price monitoring system that implements the Observer Design Pattern to notify investors (observers) whenever there is a significant change in stock prices (subject). The system should allow multiple investors to track different stocks and get notified about price fluctuations.



**Requirements**:

* Subject (Stock Market):
  * The stock market should maintain a list of observers (investors).
  * It should have methods to register, remove, and notify observers.
  * The setStockPrice method should update the stock price for a specific stock and notify all registered observers only if the price change exceeds a predefined threshold.
* Observers:
  * Create two observer classes (e.g., InvestorA and InvestorB) that implement a common Observer interface.
  * Each observer should implement an update method to receive notifications about stock price changes
* Data Representation:
  * Each stock can have attributes like stock symbol, current price, and a threshold for notification (e.g., a percentage change).



**Output**:

* The program will register two observers (InvestorA and InvestorB).
* It will notify both observers of significant stock price changes that exceed the predefined threshold.
* If an observer is removed, they will no longer receive notifications for subsequent price changes.
* The output will confirm which investors received notifications, showcasing the observer design pattern in action.



**Instructions**:

* You only need to complete the TODOs mentioned in the code.
* Please do not modify any existing code outside of the specified TODO sections.
