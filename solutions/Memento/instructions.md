# Graphic Editor Application Exercise

You are designing a graphic editor application that enables users to create and manipulate various shapes, such as circles, squares, and rectangles. Each shape has attributes, including:

* Position (x, y)
* Color
* Size

Users should be able to modify these attributes. Additionally, implement an undo feature that allows users to revert any changes made to a shape's attributes.

**Task**:

Implement the undo feature for shape attribute changes using the **Memento Design Pattern** ensuring that your solution is flexible enough to easily incorporate new shapes or attributes in the future while maintaining the ability to revert all changes.

**Output**:

After executing the code, you should save the shape's attributes to the editor three times using the specified values. Then, perform one undo operation to revert to the previous state. Finally, display the current shape attributes to confirm the changes made by the undo operation.

**Instructions**:
* You only need to complete the TODOs mentioned in the code.
* Please do not modify any existing code outside of the specified TODO sections.
